Hello, my name is Nikola Dimitrov, but most people call me Nik Di, so now I choose names that go along with \'nikdi\' :\)!
I'm quite keen on ~~gaming~~ everything, so if you want to just tag along with me, you can friend me on Discord: wasitnikdi and chat/talk with me there!

I code sometimes, when I'm bored and I push to GitHub even less often, but that doesn't matter all that much, does it?
My favourite languages are the **C Group** \(mainly **C#**, **C++** and **Arduino Framework**\), but I also ~~like~~ code in Python \(again, mainly MicroPython \[whenever needed\]\), **esphome** \(**yaml** configs\) and very recently - **HTML** with **PhaserJS** for game development, so I think that my interests are quite easy to guess - IoT Development, Desktop C-something based \(and **maybe** one day desktop game development \[stay tuned for that by the way\]\) and also, totally unrelated, but **choosing PC parts** for creating the best possible build for said amount of money and a whole bunch of other things!

In case you want more knowledge about me, then once again - please, message me on Discord!

Yes. Yes, it **wasnikdi**.
