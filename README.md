Hello, my name is Nikola Dimitrov, but most people call me Nik Di, so I decided to make it like a gaming name, so now I'm ItzNikDi :)!
I'm quite keen on gaming, so if you want to play some games with me, you can friend me on Discord: PWR | ItzNikDi#4068 and ask me

I take programming as something that I do every day, although I don't... :D
My favourite languages are the C Group (mainly C# and C++ with Arduino Framework), but I also like Python/MicroPython, so I guess you can kinda see what I'm intrested in... (if you haven't guess, then I'm gonna help - it is IoT Development)

If you need/want to know more 'bout me, then again - please, message me on Discord!
